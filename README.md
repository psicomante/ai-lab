Artificial Intelligence Laboratory: CLIPS and PROLOG projects

### CLIPS

Clips, ([home](http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/)), was created in 1985 at NASA's Johnson Space Center. It is a productive development and delivery expert system tool which provides a complete environment for the construction of rule and/or object based expert systems. 

### Prolog

Prolog (programming in logic) is one of the most widely used programming languages
in artiﬁcial intelligence research. As opposed to imperative languages such as C or Java
(which also happens to be object-oriented) it is a declarative programming language.
That means, when implementing the solution to a problem, instead of specifying how
to achieve a certain goal in a certain situation, we specify what the situation (rules and
facts) and the goal (query) are and let the Prolog interpreter derive the solution for
us. Prolog is very useful in some problem areas, such as artiﬁcial intelligence, natural
language processing, databases, but pretty useless in others, such as graphics or
numerical algorithms.
